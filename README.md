# Data collection and statistics using Python and R

[![Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

## Scripting in Python and R
The following repository offers a focus on <b>Data Collection</b>, one of the stages* of the Data Science methodology. We will also perform basic math operations on a single dataframe to see how they render using Python or R.

## Versioning

I used no vesioning system for this gist. My repository's status is flagged as <b>active</b> because it has reached a stable, usable state. Original [gist](https://gist.github.com/aiPhD/f4cdef7878e88ee2bed1254a2b5fbcb5) related to this repository is pending as <b>concept</b>.

## Sources
* Architecture appended in <b>OUTPUT.md</b>, inspired by [Cognitiveclass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai/).<br>
* Dataframe used as sample coming from [Spatialkey.com](https://support.spatialkey.com/spatialkey-sample-csv-data/).

## Exercise
* Perform data collection in `Python` and `R` using `Jupyter`.<br>
* Use the following dataframe from [Spatialkey.com](http://samplecsvs.s3.amazonaws.com/TechCrunchcontinentalUSA.csv).
* How many observations and variables do the dataframe contain? Base your assessment on your scripting outputs.
* Calculate Sum, Min, Max and Mean of variable "raisedAmt" using Python (and Pandas) and using R.
