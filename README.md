## Sources
* Architecture appended in <b>OUTPUT.md</b>, inspired by [Cognitiveclass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai/).<br>
* Dataframe used as sample coming from [Spatialkey.com](https://support.spatialkey.com/spatialkey-sample-csv-data/).

## Exercise
* Perform data collection in `Python` and `R` using `Jupyter`<br>
* Use the following dataframe from [Spatialkey.com](http://samplecsvs.s3.amazonaws.com/TechCrunchcontinentalUSA.csv).
* How many observations and variable do the dataframe contain? Base your assessment on your scripting outputs.
* Calculate Sum, Min, Max and Mean of variable "raisedAmt" using Python (and Pandas) and using R.
